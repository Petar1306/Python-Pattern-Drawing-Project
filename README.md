# Python-Pattern-Drawing-Project
🖼️ Python Pattern Drawing Project
Welcome to the Python Pattern Drawing Project! 🎉 This project is designed to help you understand and implement nested loops, conditional statements, and user inputs in Python.

📝 Project Overview
Your task is to create various patterns using Python's printing capabilities. You'll build a program where users can choose from different patterns, provide necessary inputs, and see the results displayed in the terminal.

🎯 Objectives
Practice working with nested loops.
Use if-elif-else conditions to implement logic.
Handle user input to create dynamic patterns.
Understand alignment using spaces and characters.

📋 Instructions
1️⃣ Run the Program
Start the program and choose a pattern from the menu.

2️⃣ Input Dimensions
Provide necessary inputs (e.g., number of rows or size of the shape).

3️⃣ See the Result
Enjoy the output directly in your terminal.

4️⃣ Try Again!
You can run the program again to explore different patterns.
